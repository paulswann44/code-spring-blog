# SECURITY

### Authentication- It verifies who you are
- Logging into either to facebook or gmail via a plug-in using PAM (pluggable Authentication Modules)
- Are you really the real Slim Shady?

### Authorization - what you are authorized to do 
- You are allowed to send a message in Facebook, but not delete a friend's post.  
  - Maybe this might be the difference between different levels of users:
  - Admin
  - Manager
  - Customer

- Spring will manage the security for us in the background
